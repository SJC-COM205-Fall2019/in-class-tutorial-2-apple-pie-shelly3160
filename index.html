  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 - 8 medium size apples</li>
    <li>2/3 Cup Sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tsp butter cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>1 Pie Crust recipe</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <p>Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Peel and cut apples into  slices. Place in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle 1 tsp lemon juice over the top  to prevent browning. Sprinkle on the sugar, flour, nutmeg and cinnamon. Mix  with your hands to combine.</p>
  <p>Using your pre-made pie crust, place the bottom crust inside  a 9&quot; pie plate. Make sure you have enough to overlap. Add apple filling  and press down. Dot butter on top of the apples. Cover with remaining pie  crust. Fold edges underneath and then crimp to seal. Using a fork, or a tip of a  knife, poke small holes in the top so that the steam can come out while  cooking.</p>
  <p>Place in oven and cook for about 1 hour or until the crust  is golden brown and it starts to bubble.</p>

  <p class="tip">Cooking Tip: To make sure the pie doesn't drip onto the  bottom of the oven, place a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil on the rack  underneath. That way it'll catch all drippings and make clean-up much easier.</p>
